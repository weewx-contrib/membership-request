## Membership Request Instructions

To be authorized to create a repo in this github organization, you must request us to add you as a 'member' to this github organization.

### Why ?
This is solely so we don't become a world-writable github location that can be spammed and overwhelmed with garbage.

### Request Procedure
* create a Github Issue in this repo
* fill out the template issue page
* submit the issue

### What To Expect
We'll get notified when a new request is made and will get to it hopefully pretty quickly and send you a 'github invitation' you will need to respond to by clicking on the link in the email.

In the meantime, please read the [README-FIRST](https://github.com/weewx-contrib/README-FIRST) information which has the rules of the road and the like.

Thanks !!!
