## Membership Request Instructions

To create a repo in this github organization, you must request us to add you as a 'member' to that organization.

* create a Github Issue in this repo
* fill out the template issue page
* submit the issue

We'll get notified when a new request is made and will get to it hopefully pretty quickly.

In the meantime, please read the [https://github.com/weewx-contrib/README-FIRST](README-FIRST) information which has the rules of the road and the like.

Thanks !!!
